# Calibration Task Setup
Setting up and running XAMPP
1. Download XAMPP server control panel from this page https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html

2. Run your newly downloaded installer.exe - You should be able to press next through all of the installation process without having to change any settings just make sure that it is installing to the C drive (for example C:\xampp)

3. Upon installation it will ask you if you want to run the XAMPP control panel select yes

4. Once opened, select the start action on the module entitled Apache.

5. Next, Within your XAMPP folder there is a folder titled htdocs, this is where all of the files accessed by your localhost are stored so you will need to drop all of the Github .txt files in there as well as the Goals.html file

6. Once those are all in, open your internet browser and navigate to https://localhost/goals.html and you should be done.

To download files from Github: 

1. Go to the page https://github.com/JacobH93/Calibration-Task 

2. Select the download zip option from the green button entitled "code"

3. Extract the zip file contents into your C/XAMPP/htdocs folder. Make sure that the files are directly in the htdocs folder such as C/XAMPP/htdocs/Goals.html rather than C/XAMPP/htdocs/someRandomFolder/Goals.html
